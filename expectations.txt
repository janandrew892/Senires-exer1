I expect learn many things that I did not know before. 
I wish to be able to understand the topics so that I am able to work on the exercises and projects without having too much difficulties and problems.
I hope to enjoy the my journey on CMSC 100.

EDIT: I also expect to learn many things from this course and I hope that I can enjoy and pass CMSC 100 without any troubles.
